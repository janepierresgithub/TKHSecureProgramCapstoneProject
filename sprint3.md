The second sprint of the Secure Programs Capstone project, "Penetration Testing," is a comprehensive exploration into the methodologies and significance of ethical hacking to identify potential vulnerabilities within an organization's digital infrastructure. This phase is pivotal in a cybersecurity program, especially for non-profit organizations like The Knowledge House, where maintaining donor trust and safeguarding sensitive information is paramount.

In this sprint, the team engaged in a thorough penetration testing process at The Knowledge House, utilizing a suite of tools including NMAP for network exploration, Wireshark for packet analysis, Metasploit Framework for assessing security vulnerabilities, and Burp Suite for web application security testing. These tools were instrumental in scanning the networks and website of The Knowledge House to pinpoint any potential vulnerabilities, especially focusing on server-side software and security headers, common points of exploitation in many systems.

**This repository houses two critical artifacts from this sprint:**

[Penetration Testing Summary ðŸ“ƒ](https://github.com/janepierresgithub/TKHSecureProgramCapstoneProject/blob/main/sprintthreesummary.pdf) 
A comprehensive summary of the sprint in PDF format and a portion of the PowerPoint presentation delivered to stakeholders as part of the final Capstone project. The summary provides an in-depth look into the penetration testing process, outlining the types of tests conducted, the stages involved, and the specific tools used to identify and assess vulnerabilities. 

[Penetration Testing PowerPoint Presentation ðŸ“½](https://github.com/janepierresgithub/TKHSecureProgramCapstoneProject/blob/main/sprintthreepresentation.pdf) The PowerPoint presentation segment offers a visual and narrative representation of the team's approach, findings, and recommendations, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of the penetration testing process and its outcomes.

Due to the sensitive nature of the data involved in penetration testing, particularly when conducting such activities with an organization like The Knowledge House, this repository has been curated with privacy and confidentiality as top priorities. Detailed findings and specific vulnerabilities identified during the testing process have been omitted or anonymized to protect the organization's security posture. Instead, the focus is placed on the methodology, tools, and general strategies employed to conduct the testing effectively and responsibly.

These artifacts serve not just as a record of the work done but also as a resource for understanding the critical role penetration testing plays in a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. They demonstrate the team's commitment to rigorous testing, continuous improvement, and ethical consideration in handling sensitive information. For anyone looking to understand the complexities and necessities of penetration testing in a real-world context, these documents offer valuable insights and a template for conducting responsible and effective security assessments.
