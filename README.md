Presented here is the culmination of the Secure Programs Capstone project, showcasing an intensive cybersecurity program design in collaboration with The Knowledge House, the non-profit organization behind the Innovation Fellowship that I graduated from as the Valedictorian for the Cybersecurity and Networking 2023 Cohort. Admission to The Knowledge House's Innovation Fellowship in the Cyber Security and Networking program, marked a pivotal moment for the members of the Secure Program Capstone team. Over the span of an enlightening year, this fellowship enriched the team with profound insights, experiences, and mentorship, leading to this project — a chance to both give back and display the acquired learning.

[The Knowledge House](https://www.theknowledgehouse.org) stands as a beacon of empowerment, with a resolute mission to uplift people of color and immigrants across regions including New York City, Northern New Jersey, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Their commitment to bridging the tech-skills gap through comprehensive courses has been instrumental in reshaping the technological landscape and ensuring diverse voices are not only heard but celebrated.

The capstone project, divided into six strategically designed sprints, was centered on building a foundational cybersecurity infrastructure. Throughout these intensive phases, I had the privilege of leading our team as the Project Manager.  This repository stands as a testament to diligence and passion. Every artifact included in this repository, I was heavily involved in its design, creation, implimentation or facilitation. Delve into the six sprints to appreciate the pinnacle of a year-long technological pursuit.

# <p align="center">[Sprint I: Cybersecurity Frameworks](https://github.com/janepierresgithub/TKHSecureProgramCapstoneProject/blob/main/sprint1.md)<p align="center"> 
In the first sprint, our focus was understanding the importance of cybersecurity frameworks – structured sets of policies, procedures, and standards that anchor the security of digital assets. These frameworks are paramount in safeguarding sensitive data, providing organizations a robust blueprint to minimize cyber threats.

# <p align="center">[Sprint II: Threat & Vulnerability Assessments](https://github.com/janepierresgithub/TKHSecureProgramCapstoneProject/blob/main/sprint2.md)<p align="center"> 
A thorough examination of potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact The Knowledge House's digital assets was carried out. This involved identifying potential weaknesses in the system, understanding external threats, and categorizing them based on their severity and potential impact.

# <p align="center">[Sprint III: Penetration Testing](https://github.com/janepierresgithub/TKHSecureProgramCapstoneProject/blob/main/sprint3.md)<p align="center">
Going beyond theory, this sprint focused on practical, offensive security efforts. By simulating cyberattacks on organizational assets, participants gauged the efficacy of existing security measures and identified areas of improvement.

# <p align="center">[Sprint IV: Legal, Regulatory & Compliance](https://github.com/janepierresgithub/TKHSecureProgramCapstoneProject/blob/main/sprint4.md)<p align="center">
Addressing the legal landscape, this sprint dealt with understanding the legal implications of cybersecurity efforts. Compliance with established regulations was prioritized. 

# <p align="center">[Sprint V: Development of Policies, Procedures, and Standards](https://github.com/janepierresgithub/TKHSecureProgramCapstoneProject/blob/main/sprint5.md)<p align="center">
Moving towards operational excellence, this sprint was geared towards the creation of robust cybersecurity policies and procedures. This framework ensured a consistent and systematic approach to handling security threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.

# <p align="center">[Sprint VI: Incident Management and Disaster Recovery Plans](https://github.com/janepierresgithub/TKHSecureProgramCapstoneProject/blob/main/sprint6.md)<p align="center">
Concluding the project, this sprint emphasized managing cybersecurity incidents effectively. It also focused on establishing a disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity in case of severe breaches. The culmination of the capstone was the presentation of a detailed security report, complete with documentation that encapsulated all project findings and recommendations.
