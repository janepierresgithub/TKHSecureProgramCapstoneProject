# Secure Program Capstone Project

The Secure Programs Capstone project was an intensive cybersecurity program design, developed in close collaboration with our client, The Knowledge House. The Knowledge House is a non-profit educational organization with a mission to empower people of color and immigrants in the New York City, Northern New Jersey, Atlanta and Los Angeles. They aim to bridge the tech-skills gap by providing comprehensive courses and platforms for these groups to thrive in the technology sector.

The Capstone project was structured into six main sprints, designed to encapsulate the essence of building a robust cybersecurity infrastructure from the ground up.
