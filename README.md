I am honored to present the work accomplished during the Secure Programs Capstone project, a testament to the intensive cybersecurity program design skills honed in collaboration with our client, The Knowledge House. Being granted admission to The Knowledge House's Innovation Fellowship in the Cyber Security and Networking program was a pivotal moment for myself and the members of the Secure Program Capstone team. Over a transformative year, the fellowship provided us with invaluable insights, experiences, and mentorship, culminating in this project which served as a fitting opportunity to give back and demonstrate the knowledge and expertise garnered.

The Knowledge House stands as a beacon of empowerment, with a resolute mission to uplift people of color and immigrants across regions including New York City, Northern New Jersey, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Their commitment to bridging the tech-skills gap through comprehensive courses has been instrumental in reshaping the technological landscape and ensuring diverse voices are not only heard but celebrated.

Our capstone journey spanned six meticulously structured sprints, each aiming to embed the principles of robust cybersecurity infrastructure. Throughout these intensive phases, I had the privilege of leading our talented team as the Project Manager. It was not merely about overseeing; it was about infusing each aspect with precision, ensuring that our designs were detailed and our implementations were seamless.

This repository is more than just a digital archive. Each link, document, and artifact below is a reflection of the dedication and passion that went into its creation. I had a direct hand in various facets of this project—whether it was conceptualizing, editing, designing, implementing, or facilitating. Explore and delve into our six sprints to witness the culmination of our year-long technological odyssey.

# [Sprint I: Cybersecurity Frameworks](https://github.com/janepierresgithub/TKHSecureProgramCapstoneProject/blob/main/sprint1.md) 
In the first sprint, our focus was understanding the importance of cybersecurity frameworks – structured sets of policies, procedures, and standards that anchor the security of digital assets. These frameworks are paramount in safeguarding sensitive data, providing organizations a robust blueprint to minimize cyber threats. Click the link to explore our considerations in selecting the cybersecurity frameworks, the importance of frameworks like NIST 800-171, and their role in fortifying secure programs.
