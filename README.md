Presented here is the culmination of the Secure Programs Capstone project, showcasing an intensive cybersecurity program design in collaboration with The Knowledge House, the non-profit organization who offers the Innovation Fellowship of which I was a part of for their 2022-2023 Cohort. Admission to The Knowledge House's Innovation Fellowship in the Cyber Security and Networking program, marked a pivotal moment for the members of the Secure Program Capstone team. Over the span of an enlightening year, this fellowship enriched the team with profound insights, experiences, and mentorship, leading to this project — a chance to both give back and display the acquired expertise.

[The Knowledge House](https://www.theknowledgehouse.org) stands as a beacon of empowerment, with a resolute mission to uplift people of color and immigrants across regions including New York City, Northern New Jersey, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Their commitment to bridging the tech-skills gap through comprehensive courses has been instrumental in reshaping the technological landscape and ensuring diverse voices are not only heard but celebrated.

The capstone project, divided into six strategically designed sprints, was centered on building a foundational cybersecurity infrastructure. Throughout these intensive phases, I had the privilege of leading our talented team as the Project Manager. It was not merely about overseeing; it was about infusing each aspect with precision, ensuring that our designs were detailed and our implementations were seamless.

This repository stands as a testament to diligence and passion. Every link, document, and artifact encapsulates a commitment to excellence. The touchpoints of conceptualizing, editing, designing, implementing, and facilitating can be felt throughout. Delve into the six sprints to appreciate the pinnacle of a year-long technological pursuit.

# [Sprint I: Cybersecurity Frameworks](https://github.com/janepierresgithub/TKHSecureProgramCapstoneProject/blob/main/sprint1.md) 
In the first sprint, our focus was understanding the importance of cybersecurity frameworks – structured sets of policies, procedures, and standards that anchor the security of digital assets. These frameworks are paramount in safeguarding sensitive data, providing organizations a robust blueprint to minimize cyber threats. Click the link to explore our considerations in selecting the cybersecurity frameworks, the importance of frameworks like NIST 800-171, and their role in fortifying secure programs.
