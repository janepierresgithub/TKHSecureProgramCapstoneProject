Sprint five of the Secure Programs Capstone project, titled "Development of Policies, Procedures, and Standards," is a crucial phase in establishing the cybersecurity framework for The Knowledge House. This sprint addresses the development of robust policies that are foundational to maintaining a secure digital environment in the increasingly interconnected and threat-prone digital landscape.

The main artifacts from this sprint are the sprint summary, the PowerPoint presentation and a sample of the technical policy mannual. 

[Legal, Regulatory & Compliance Summary ðŸ“ƒ](https://github.com/janepierresgithub/TKHSecureProgramCapstoneProject/blob/main/sprintfoursummary.pdf) The summary delves into the formulation of four key policies: access management, password policy, remote work policy, and incident response policy. Each policy is meticulously crafted to enhance the security and integrity of operations at The Knowledge House.
