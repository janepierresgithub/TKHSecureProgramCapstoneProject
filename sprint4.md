# <p align="center"> Sprint Four - Legal, Regulatory & Compliance <p align="center">

Sprint four of the Secure Programs Capstone project, "Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance," marks a critical transition from technical cybersecurity measures to understanding and implementing the legal and regulatory frameworks that underpin a robust cybersecurity strategy. This phase focuses on ensuring that The Knowledge House's cybersecurity practices align with laws like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), New York's SHIELD Act, and industry standards like the PCI DSS. These regulations are vital for non-profits, as they safeguard sensitive data and maintain the trust of donors, partners, and beneficiaries.

Within the repository, the primary artifacts from this sprint are the comprehensive summary of the sprint and a segment of the PowerPoint presentation delivered to stakeholders. The summary delves into the various laws and regulations pertinent to cybersecurity, highlighting their implications for medium-sized non-profit organizations like The Knowledge House. It outlines the essential components of the PCI DSS and other critical standards, illustrating how adherence not only mitigates the risk of penalties and reputational damage but also reinforces trust and compliance.
