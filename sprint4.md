Sprint four of the Secure Programs Capstone project, "Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance," marks a critical transition from technical cybersecurity measures to understanding and implementing the legal and regulatory frameworks that underpin a robust cybersecurity strategy. This milestone focuses on ensuring that The Knowledge House's cybersecurity practices align with laws like the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), New York's SHIELD Act, and industry standards like the PCI DSS. These regulations are vital for non-profits, as they safeguard sensitive data and maintain the trust of donors, partners, and beneficiaries.

Due to the nature of the content, dealing with legal and regulatory aspects and the sensitive information of The Knowledge House, this repository is curated with utmost consideration for privacy and confidentiality. Detailed legal analyses and specific compliance strategies have been carefully presented to respect the sensitive nature of this information while providing a comprehensive view of the legal and regulatory landscape. Within the repository, the primary artifacts from this sprint are the comprehensive summary of the sprint and a segment of the PowerPoint presentation delivered to stakeholders. 

These artifacts from Sprint 4 embody the team's dedication to not just technical cybersecurity solutions but also to a deeper understanding of the legal and regulatory environment.
